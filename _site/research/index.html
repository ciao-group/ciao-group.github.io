  <p> The influence of digital products on our everyday life is continuously growing. Smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices are ever-present. They become smarter, more personalized, and more capable from generation to generation. Considering the ever-growing system complexity and the increasing expectations toward these devices, a traditional qualitative product design approach is no longer sufficient to fulfill customers’ needs. However, data-driven and AI-powered approaches can effectively reduce the effort of extensive user studies and expensive simulations. Machine learning-based user modeling and big data analytics allow for insights that go beyond traditional UX research approaches. Our research aims to help designers, researchers, and decision-makers to better understand how users interact with digital devices in their real-world context. This question is not only crucial for developing systems that are easy and safe to use but also key for business decisions throughout the product development process. </p>

    <h4 style="overflow: hidden"> Our Vision </h4>
    <p style="overflow: hidden"> At CIAO we strongly believe that the design, development, and evaluation of intelligent mobile devices (which includes cars) is not yet human-centered enough. This leads to decisions that are detached from customer needs and real-world problems. We want to rethink the current design process. Data-driven insights and machine learning-based user modeling need to be an integral part of the product development and evaluation process. Only by doing so, one can account for the variety of individual and contextual factors and build systems that are easy and safe to use for all users in all situations. We aim to contribute to a better understanding of how humans interact with intelligent mobile interfaces and transportation systems by developing new data-driven user models and evaluation methods (1) based on supervised machine learning and (2) based on the theory of computational rationality and reinforcement learning. </p>

    <h4 style="overflow: hidden; padding: 0px 16px"> Data-Driven Driver Modeling </h4>
    <p style="padding: 0px 16px"> The goal of CIAOs research is to better understand how drivers allocate their resources while engaging in secondary tasks. A deep understanding of human multitasking and how distraction affects driving behavior and vice versa facilitates the design of safe automotive HMIs. We combine large-scale user interaction data with driving data and glance behavior data to model driver’s distraction, behavioral adaption, and sensitivity to the driving context. While we apply statistical modeling to evaluate new design artifacts, we also apply various machine learning approaches to predict human interaction behavior to not only better understand the interaction itself but also to evaluate new interfaces already before the first user study is run. </p>

    <h4 style="overflow: hidden"> Computationally Rational User Models </h4>
    <p style="overflow: hidden"> Computationally rational theories assume that users choose their behavior to maximize their expected utility, given their bounds. Applied to human-computer interaction, users interact with technology so that they can achieve an optimal outcome given their internal (e.g., cognition or perception) and external (e.g., environment or design of a tool) bounds. Thus, users adapt their behavioral policies or strategies to maximize their utility. These policies can be approximated via reinforcement learning, yielding verifiable predictions of user interaction behavior. Although machine learning is used to learn behavioral policies and make predictions, the formulated bounds (e.g., perceptual or motor constraints) limit the space of computable interaction strategies of the agent so that the interactions represent realistic human behavior. </p>
